This is just a little side project I decided to pick up. The goal of it is to show how long it would take to break even 
a simple RSA encrpytion. The goal is to try and use my own code as much as possible with as little API usage as possible.

I know that it will probably make the dev process a little longer but the goal of this project is more understanding the code
and what is going on behind the scene. 

Once I know the encrpytion is working properly, I will then write another piece of code to try and crack it

Feel free to download it and mess around with it if you want to get a better understanding of RSA Encrpytion and how 
secure it really is
